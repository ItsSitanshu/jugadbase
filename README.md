A database built for JugadInnovations. Why go for complex systems when a little clever "jugad" can get the job done faster and smarter? It's simple, efficient, and just works — because sometimes, the best solutions are the ones that skip the fluff.

## To-do List

- ~~Implement proper parsing~~
- ~~FIX BUG: offset from [create_table()](https://github.com/ItsSitanshu/jugadbase/blob/5ec3f58/src/db/executor.c#L39-L139) doesn't work as expected~~
